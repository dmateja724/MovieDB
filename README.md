# Getting the app setup

Having a React Native environment configured on your machine will be required. You can follow the React Native CLI Quickstart guide [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) if your machine isn't configured yet.

To get the app ready for use run `npm run configure`, that will install node modules and cocoa pods.

# Starting the app

Once the app is configured all you need to do is run this command in your terminal

- `npm start`

And then in a separate terminal run

- `npm run ios` for iOS
- `npm run android` for Android
